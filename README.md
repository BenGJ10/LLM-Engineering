### 2. Adversarial Chat: GPT-4o vs. Ollama

This project simulates an adversarial conversation between OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini and a locally running Ollama model ‚Äî ideal for exploring model alignment, reasoning contrast, and response style differences.

- **Input**: Custom system prompts and a seed discussion topic
- **Process**:
  - Alternates dialogue between GPT and Ollama in a turn-based format
  - Formats prompts to match OpenAI‚Äôs `messages` structure and Ollama‚Äôs raw text prompt style
  - Maintains conversation context across multiple turns
- **Output**: Structured debate transcript printed live in the notebook
- **Tech**: OpenAI API, Ollama 3.2
