### 3. Adversarial Chat: GPT-4o vs. Ollama

This project simulates an adversarial conversation between OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini and a locally running Ollama model â€” ideal for exploring model alignment, reasoning contrast, and response style differences.

- **Input**: Custom system prompts and a seed discussion topic
- **Process**:
  - Alternates dialogue between GPT and Ollama in a turn-based format
  - Formats prompts to match OpenAIâ€™s `messages` structure and Ollamaâ€™s raw text prompt style
  - Maintains conversation context across multiple turns
- **Output**: Structured debate transcript printed live in the notebook
- **Tech**: OpenAI API, Ollama 3.2

### 4. DeutschMeister: AI German Language Coach

An interactive AI-powered German language tutor built with Gradio and OpenAIâ€™s Chat API. It helps users learn, practice, and prepare for German exams with tailored lessons, exercises, and exam simulations based on the user's level (A1â€“C2) and mode (Lesson, Practice, Exam Prep).

- **Input**: Userâ€™s German proficiency level and selected mode; user questions or requests
- **Process**:
  - Uses a detailed system prompt as a professional German language educator
  - Maintains conversational context for personalized responses
  - Provides structured markdown output including grammar explanations, tables, quizzes, and encouragement
- **Output**: Interactive chat responses formatted with headings, bullet points, tables, code blocks, and quizzes
- **Tech**: OpenAI API, Gradio UI
